# Homework Project: Next.js App with Menu and API Integration
## Objective
The goal of this project is to assess your React.js and Next.js skills by creating an application that replicates a design from a provided Figma page. The project will require you to implement a menu and fetch data from an API endpoint with a hardcoded response.

## Requirements
1. Environment Setup: Set up a new Next.js project.
2. Figma Design: Implement the design provided in the Figma page. Pay close attention to dimensions, colors, and fonts.
3. Menu: Implement a dynamic menu.
    - The menu should contain buttons.
    - The buttons activation should dynamically change them, the selected on should be visually understandable.
    - When activation a button, information given by the API should be put on the right areas of the page (e.g., Team name should change from Team GO to something else).
4. API Endpoint: Create a mock API endpoint that returns hardcoded data for the buttons activations (e.g., club name, icons).
Use this data to populate the screen when buttons are activated.
5. Code Quality: Your code should be well-organized and commented where necessary.
## Technical Stack
- React.js
- Next.js
- TypeScript
## Deliverables
1. A GitHub repository containing your Next project.
2. A README.md file with:
    - Setup instructions.
    - Explanation of design decisions and trade-offs made.
    - Any additional libraries or tools used.
## Evaluation Criteria
- **Fidelity to Figma Design**: How closely does your implementation match the provided Figma design?
- **Functionality**: Does the menu work as expected? Is it smooth?
- **API Integration**: Is the hardcoded API endpoint correctly implemented? Is the screen populated with this data?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, clean, and well-commented?
## Submission Deadline
Please submit your project before the deadline discussed with the Team.
